- 👋 Hi, my name is Nikolay Tonchev
- 👀 I have many interests, one of which is obviously programming which I am trying to learn enough for now to become a junior dev. Other hobbies are gaming, music, photography cooking & etc.
- 🌱 I am currently working as a Full-Stack .NET Core developper with VanillaJS. I would like to further expand into one of the JS Frameworks. I am also interested in other technologies and programming languages, and would like to learn them in the future.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on anything I can help with at my level of knowledged. Learning through experience is one of the best methods of learning.
- 📫 You can reach me via my e-mail: nikolaytonchev.89@gmail.com
